# Python_DSA

1. build Stack structure by List and reverse string by Stack
   
   is_empty(), push(item), pop(), peek(), size()
   
2. 2D list: Maze
   
   -- read Maze from .txt file
   
   -- Trace maze path from start to goal

   -- DFS by Stack

3. Queue by collection.deque

   -- is_empty(), enqueue(), dequeue(), peek(), size(), str()

   -- BFS algorithm by Queue
   
4. A-star algorithm by Priority Queue
   
   -- the shortest path
